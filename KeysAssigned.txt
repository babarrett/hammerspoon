Generally:
	Hammerspoon for:	HyperFn, Window sizing, Screen and Space management
						init.lua. *.lua. Shared configurations. Fully programable.
	Karabiner for:		SpaceFn, ()-like pairs
						private.xml (or SpaceFN_bruce.xml) Shared configurations. 
						Capable, but not fully programable. No events?
	USB Overdrive for:	(replace with other?)
						Easy to configure. Some sharing possible.
						No Apple products
	BBEdit for:			Code snippets. Auto-completion.  Navigate by f()
	iTerm2 for:			Command-line keys, remap (begin/end line & word)

* USB Overdrive cannot modify non-Apple products, by design.
	These functions should be moved to other products/systems
	such as Hammerspoon or Karabiner:
	a) so that external Apple keyboards, such as those with numeric pads, work, and
	b) so that fewer keyboard interceptors are in use, simplifying implementation
		and tracking.

Things to consider adding:
	
Screen and Space management
Rotate right by 1, maybe: SpaceFn+(TYUIOP)
alias g=git
