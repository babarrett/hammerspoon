* USB Overdrive cannot modify non-Apple products, by design.
	These functions should be moved to other products/systems
	such as Hammerspoon or Karabiner:
	a) so that external Apple keyboards, such as those with numeric pads, work, and
	b) so that fewer keyboard interceptors are in use, simplifying implementation
		and tracking.
