# Layout Ideas

Cleaver things I've heard of and thought of.

## Things I do need to enter:
* a-z, A-Z, 0-9, punct
* Space, Tab, Return
* Command (⌘) + anything
* Command (⌘) + Shift + anything
* Option  (⌥) + anything
* Control (^) + anything


## Use layer for Shift, not the modifier
#### Idea
Instead of passing the shift modifier for a character change, say Shift + ' = "
separate your "lowercase" layer from your "uppercase" layer. Then, if you want,
you can put the " on the "lowercase" layer, and ' on the uppercase.

#### Pros
* 23 Shifted characters (!@#$%^&*()_+{}|:"<>?~) can all be reached w/o shifting, if you like.
* Avoids the problem of wanting ? unshifted, / shifted, because of frequency of use.
* Could put all the punctuation in the same layer.
* Because of the above, could save a modifier key (maybe)

#### Cons
* Requires at least 1 more layer, but maybe even double the number of layers.


## Use the same key for up and down arrow
#### Idea
So three adjacent keys of the keyboard looks like:
```
    +-----+-------+-----+
    |     |   ^   |     |
    |  <  |       |  >  |
    |     |   v   |     |
    +-----+-------+-----+
```

Up-arrow is a shifted version of the (default) down arrow.

#### Pros
* Save a key in the layout
* Fingers don't have to leave the keys

#### Cons
* Shift + Up and down arrows to select line above / below won't work in that way.
* So may requiring a different layer/modifier for that. Maybe not so bad, That
seems to be a less frequent operation.




## SpaceFn, HyperFn, Meh
#### Idea
Hold (or tap in the case of "one-shots") for another "layer"

#### Pros
* Expand keyboard options
* Map infrequent combinations to it / them (Cmd+Option)
* Macros

#### Cons
* None?

## SpaceFn + X,C,V,Z
#### Idea
Use SpaceFn for Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo

#### Pros
* Use it all the time on laptop now
* Comfortable
* Likely transition well to other keyboard layouts

#### Cons
* None?
* Need to be careful about the definition of SpaceFN or space won't repeat.

## Hold Home row keys for Modifier or Layer changes
#### Idea


#### Pros
* Fingers don't leave home row
* Wouldn't have to do all 4 modifiers, just the most common? Like #s and F#s.

#### Cons
* Can't modify the key you're using as the modifier (unless it's a "long hold?")
* May be hard to get used to
* For full coverage you may need FDSA to reflect JKL;
* If reflected may need 2 * number of modifiers layers to cover it.

## Press and hold for additional functionality
#### Idea
Hole Delete (Backspace) for Forward delete. Hold "Copy" for "Cut."

#### Pros
* Save a key
* Closer at hand

#### Cons
* Can't repeat

## "Sticky" or "On-shots for Modifiers, layers
#### Idea
So used to this on Mac!

#### Pros
* Less work load on hands
* Algernon uses only on one side of the keyboard. Saving keys.
* c

#### Cons
* Many implementations count the next press, even if another modifier or layer as firing.
* b
* c

## Tap-dance
#### Idea
Instead of Shift+9 or Shift-0, I tap [ / ] twice. Only one finger used, less
movement, less stretching, and all the brackets are on one key. Sounds like a
win to me! No layer to switch, no key to hold or have on one-shot, just one
finger is all it takes.

#### Pros
* Fake layering: The situation described above: having one key to three things,
to reduce movement, and to have similar symbols on the same key.

* Avoiding modifiers: Somewhat similar to the previous example, but different in
subtle ways. The case of my : key is the perfect demonstration: it is on the
thumb cluster, because it is used often while programming, but so is Shift, and
on the same side, too! Moving the thumb is slow, tapping the same key twice with
it, less so.

* Modifier/symbol dual-use: A single key should act as a modifier when held, but
as a regular key when tapped. When tapped twice and then held, it should keep
the regular key registered until release. This makes it possible to have a - say
- Ctrl/Z key, with a way to allow Z to repeat!


#### Cons
* a
* b
* c
